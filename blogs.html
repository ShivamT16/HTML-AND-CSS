            <h2>Hostel Life</h2>
            <p>After 12th we start our college life. We enter in a whole new world, new friends, new culture, new enviornment and for many its new city, new state and many new experiences. No doubt, we all get excited and we should be. This is the phase
                we were waiting for from our 11th,12th class. We get lot of oppurtunity from the day one as to join different clubs, society etc.</p>
            <p>Apart from this, lets talk about students who left their home beacuse of shifting to other city or other state or even other country, Now there is from where the comfort zone ends(PS: I'm talking about middle class students). Students who
                have not done a single thing in their home, now doing everything thing beacuse now they don't have Mummy or Papa just behind them. Even students gets habitual to all these things within a month of their hostel life, and I think everyone
                should experience hostel life once in their student life atleast for a year. It makes youu self independent, learn to survive a day in minimum amount of money and many things. Once you feel that discomfort of staying away from away, then
                you'll surely realise the value of a family,home and parents.

            <h2>playcode.io</h2>
            <p>So from starting when we start coding irrespective of any programming language, we come across many platforms. When I started this journey of Web development, I started from replit,codesandbox, and vscode.Although they also provide every programming
                to work both online and with desktop application. we love vscode because of many factors, be it simple and advanced, lots of extensions, or easy sync with Github, vs provides it all in its desktop application.</p>
            <p>A Few days back I asked about a good online editor on the neoG discord community and got this answer: playcode.io Playcode is a good online editor, offering everything like our vsCode. The best thing is the real-time console and website view
                window means you can see your every change in a single window.It is advanced as well as smooth with a good UI too.</p>
            <p>You can code in multiple environments like Js, React, etc.</p>
            <p>They also have a few beginner-friendly exercises to learn Html, CSS, and Js basics. A playcode community is also their on Discord to chat and explore new things with new friends. Much more things to still explore.....</p>
