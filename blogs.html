            <h2>Hostel Life</h2>
            <p>After 12th we start our college life. We enter in a whole new world, new friends, new culture, new enviornment and for many its new city, new state and many new experiences. No doubt, we all get excited and we should be. This is the phase
                we were waiting for from our 11th,12th class. We get lot of oppurtunity from the day one as to join different clubs, society etc.</p>
            <p>Apart from this, lets talk about students who left their home beacuse of shifting to other city or other state or even other country, Now there is from where the comfort zone ends(PS: I'm talking about middle class students). Students who
                have not done a single thing in their home, now doing everything thing beacuse now they don't have Mummy or Papa just behind them. Even students gets habitual to all these things within a month of their hostel life, and I think everyone
                should experience hostel life once in their student life atleast for a year. It makes youu self independent, learn to survive a day in minimum amount of money and many things. Once you feel that discomfort of staying away from away, then
                you'll surely realise the value of a family,home and parents.
